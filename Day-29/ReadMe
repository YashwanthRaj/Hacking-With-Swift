## Word Scrambler Game

The game will show players a random eight-letter word, and ask them to make words out of it. For example, if the starter word is “alarming” they might spell “alarm”, “ring”, “main”, and so on.

The job of **`List`** is to provide a scrolling table of data. In fact, it’s pretty much identical to **`Form`**, except it’s used for presentation of data rather than requesting user input. Don’t get me wrong: you’ll use **`Form`** quite a lot too, but really it’s just a specialized type of **`List`**.

Just like **`Form`**, you can provide **`List`** a selection of static views to have them rendered in individual rows.  everything you’ve seen so far works fine with **`Form`** as well as **`List`** – even the dynamic content. But one thing **`List`** can do that **`Form`** can’t is to generate its rows entirely from dynamic content without needing a **`ForEach`**.

When working with an array of data, SwiftUI still needs to know how to identify each row uniquely, so if one gets removed it can simply remove that one rather than having to redraw the whole list. This is where the **`id`** parameter comes in, and it works identically in both **`List`** and **`ForEach`** – it lets us tell SwiftUI exactly what makes each item in the array unique.

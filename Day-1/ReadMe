In this modeule we have covered Variables, constants, strings, and numbers.

SUMMARY
  
Variable
Whose value can be changed after declaration.
Syntax -> var greeting = "Hello World"
var keyword to create a new variable, followed by variable name, then assigning then String/Value to the variable. 
We only need var to create a new variable, not change or access the variable.

Constant
Whose Value cannot be changed after declaration.
Syntax -> let variable_name = "Hello World"
let keyword to create a constant. Rest the same as variable. 

Data Types
String → Characters
Int → Whole Numbers
Double → Decimal numbers
Boolean → Stores Truth and False

We cannot perform operations between different data types. When a variable is created, we swift assigns a datatype to it. Later when we change the value, we cannot directly assign value of different data type.
